track professors, students and courses.
check grades, check who is teaching a course.
what courses are offered?
who teaches those courses?
what students are enrolled in those courses?
track grade of each of its students across all courses.
for each student and professor, the school needs to know
their address, phone number, name and age.

each course has a maximum and minimum number of students
that they can enroll.
if the minimum number of students is not reacheed,
then the course will be cancelled.
Each course is taught by at least one professor but
sometimes may be taught by many.

professors are salaried employees and therefore we need to
keep track of how much they make each year.
if a professor teaches more than 4 courses in a semester
then they are granted a one time bonus of $20,000.

students can be both local or international students and
full or part time. A student is considered a part time student if they are
enrolled in 1 or 2 courses during any given semester.
The maximum number of courses a student may be enrolled in at one time is 6.
Students receive grades from each course, these grades are numeric in the range of 0-100.
Any students that have an average grade across all enrolled courses lower than 60%
is said to be on academic probation.

note: this system will be reset and updated at the end of each semester.
